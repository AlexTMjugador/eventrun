Description: eventrun
 Runs a command when a Linux input device sends an event, no matter if X runs. Both input
 device and event are configurable in /etc/eventrun. Each eventrun
 instance can react on several input events on the same input device, if
 the configuration file is modified accordingly.
 Additionally, a SystemV-style service is installed in /etc/init.d, which allows to
 run this program daemonized on system start after executing update-rc.d.
